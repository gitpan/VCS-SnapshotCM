VCS::SnapshotCM is currently mainly a container for the whistory and
wannotate scripts. It contains a module, VCS::SnapshotCM::Tools, but
its interface is not considered stable.

See the whistory and wannotate documentation for details.

It would be nice to have VCS::SnapshotCM compatible with the other
VCS:: modules. Patches welcome.
